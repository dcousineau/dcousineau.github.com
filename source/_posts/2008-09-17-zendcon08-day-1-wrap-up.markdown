Turned out to be a fairly exciting day. I woke up late wondering why my alarms didn't go off, just barely got to lunch and regretted missing [Jay Pipes](http://www.jpipes.com/index.php)' talk.

[Sara Golemon](http://blog.libssh2.org/) gave an interesting introduction to PHP extension writing. I bow to her vastly superior C-fu.

I [already](/blog/2008/09/16/zendcon-day-1-pecl-picks/) [discussed](/blog/2008/09/16/zendcon08-day-1-the-knight-rider-methodology-to-software-development/) a few talks that I went to yesterday as well.

Ended the night doing a pub crawl with some people (hung out with Jay Pipes at the end which is what caused me to regret missing his talk).
