Naturally it's been over a month since I've updated and rather than posting something techincal I feel I should be a little selfish and announce that:



### I'M GOING TO BE SPEAKING AT [ZENDCON 09](http://zendcon.com/)!



I will be giving my talk on automated deployment techniques with Phing.

To say that I'm excited is quite an understatement. Nervous now probably tops excitement as now I have to make sure I give a damned good talk and not make [Eli White](http://eliw.com/) look like a fool for having picked me for a slot.

Time to go bury my nose in Power Point and research!
