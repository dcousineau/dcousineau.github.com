PHP 4's end-of-life is [today](http://shiflett.org/blog/2008/aug/end-of-life-for-php-4).

With that I bid adieu to the half-assed OOP support and general primitive nature of the platform.

However I cannot be so callous as my first forays into PHP were with 4.0 releases...

Now the question is how much faster will the dumping of PHP 4 (and 5.0/5.1) be and the adoption of PHP 5.2? Granted most major services are already at the latest/later versions of PHP 5.2 (5.2.5 seems to be most common, but quite a few have 5.2.6 installed), I hope the prevalence extends even further as I'm writing an app that requires 5.2.3+ (damn you Doctrine and your shiny ways!)...
