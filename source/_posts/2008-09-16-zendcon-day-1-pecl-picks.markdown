[Elizabeth Smith](http://elizabethmariesmith.com/) discussed to a really interesting PECL extension, [pecl_http](http://pecl.php.net/package/pecl_http). I can do request pooling!

She also discussed [pdo_user](http://pecl.php.net/package/pdo_user) that allows you to create PDO drivers in userland (PHP).

Good overview on PECL packages. It makes me sad that they have really cool extensions like the operator overload extension and I can use them because I have to worry about install bases of other users :( Damned shared hosts.
