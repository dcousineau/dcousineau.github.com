I've started to amass a large amount of feeds in my reader and I thought I'd share a few with you:




> 
**[PHPDeveloper.org](http://www.phpdeveloper.org/)** ([feed](http://www.phpdeveloper.org/phpdev.rdf))

Great aggregation of blog posts and updates in the PHP world.






> 
**[Zend Developer Zone](http://devzone.zend.com/public/view)** ([feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ZendDeveloperZone))

Zend's place for all things PHP related






> 
**[SitePoint.com](http://www.sitepoint.com/)** ([blogs](http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/feed/)) ([articles](http://www.sitepoint.com/recent.rdf))

The infamous SitePoint. Not entirely PHP, but excellent web related articles and a good way to keep loose tabs on the other web spheres (ASP.NET and RoR in particular)






> 
**[Particletree](http://particletree.com/)** ([feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/particletree))

Doesn't update very often, but each article is a gem (in terms of solving a programming problem).






> 
**[Chris Shiflett](http://shiflett.org/)** ([feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/shiflett))

THE PHP and Web Application Security guy.






> 
**[Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/)** ([feed](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/rss.xml))

A classic, not really PHP oriented.




And finally, definitely not PHP focused, but a very good blog to read if you do any MySQL work (if you are a PHP person, chances are this includes you)



> 
**[MySQL Performance Blog](http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/)** ([feed](http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/feed/))

Great collection of articles and talks on optimizing MySQL, either at the server or query level, and more...




While this isn't all of the feeds I have on programming related topics, some of them are new adds and I want to give it some time before I share the links.
