Your blogger for the evening is Daniel Cousineau, developer at [Splash Media](http://splashmedia.com)

I have been on computers since before my infantile amnesia phase (take psychology), only knowing this through a picture of me leaning on the keyboard of a Compaq Portable II.

I first worked with HTML around 1998, 1999 and have fallen in love with the web industry ever since. You can find me on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/dcousineau), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/dcousineau), [GitHub](https://github.com/dcousineau), and a few other websites I don't feel like listing at the moment. I can be contacted through my various social networks or a comment on this blog.
